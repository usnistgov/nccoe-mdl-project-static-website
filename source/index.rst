Digital Identities - Mobile Driver's License (mDL)
==================================================

The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) is helping to
accelerate the adoption of mobile driver’s license (mDL) standards and
best practices. In collaboration with technology vendors, government
agencies, regulators, standards bodies, and organizations seeking to
adopt mDLs, the NCCoE is building a reference architecture demonstrating
real world use cases:

1. **Customer Identification Program/Know Your Customer (CIP/KYC)
   Onboarding and Access** which will demonstrate the use of an mDL
   and/or Verifiable Credentials (VC) for establishing and accessing an
   online financial account.

2. **U.S. Federal Government Credential Service Provider (CSP) and
   Federation** which will demonstrate the use of an mDL and/or VC for
   establishing a CSP account to access federated agency systems.

3. **Healthcare and Electronic Prescribe** which will demonstrate the
   use of an mDL and/or VC for provider access and prescription uses.

NCCoE is currently implementing our first use case to demonstrate how
mDLs can be deployed to meet CIP/KYC requirements of financial
institutions. To learn more about this project and the industry
collaborators who have partnered with NIST to solve this challenge,
please visit our `project web
page <https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/digital-identities-mdl>`__. To
gain a better understanding of the technology and standards the NCCoE
will be implementing as part of this project, please consider
reading `our blog
series <https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/digital-identities-getting-know-verifiable-digital-credential-ecosystem>`__. *The
page you are currently on* will be used to publish additional content
for the NCCoE mDL Project to include project criteria and a sample bank mDL information page.

*As part of this project, the NCCoE will be deploying the "NCCoE Bank",
a fictitious bank that will demonstrate how mDLs might be implemented at
a real financial institution. Currently, we have published our* `Draft CIP/KYC use case criteria <criteria.html>`__,
*which will be used when deploying our architecture for the NCCoE Bank. Additionally, we have created videos and flows
implemented as* `wireframes <wireframes.html>`__ *to provide a visual representation of a customer navigating a sample
bank site. These wireframes illustrate the step-by-step process in a browser on a laptop or desktop device.
We have also published a* `SAMPLE Bank mDL Information Page <nccoe-bank-faq.html>`__ *that mimics information pages
currently in use by financial institutions and highlights the benefits that mDLs
might provide customers of those institutions.*

**Project Participants:**

Organizations participating in this project submitted their capabilities
in response to an open call in the Federal Register for all sources of
relevant security capabilities from academia and industry (vendors and
integrators). The following respondents with relevant capabilities or
product components (identified as “Technology Partners/Collaborators”
herein) signed a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement to
