**Instructions for submitting comments by creating an issue on GitHub**

Establish a GitHub account. In order to submit a comment through the GitHub
“Issues” feature, you will need to create a GitHub account. This can be done by
proceeding to github.com/join. GitHub allows you to remain pseudonymous if you
would like, just make sure you select the options that suit you on the
“Profile” and “Emails” pages of your “Personal Settings.” We also highly
encourage you to turn on two-factor authentication in the “Security” page,
also part of “Personal Settings.”


1. Click here to go to the issues page on Github: https://github.com/usnistgov/nccoe-mdl-project-static-website/issues

2. Review open and closed issues to determine if a similar issue has already been created.

3. Click on the “New Issue” button in the upper right of the screen.

4. Click "Get Started" to start drafting a new comment.

5. Fill in the form fields.

6. Click “Submit New Issue” and you are done!


We greatly appreciate your comments and feedback.

Thank you,
The NCCoE Project Team
