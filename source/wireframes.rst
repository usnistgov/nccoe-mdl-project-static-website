*NOTE: The NCCoE Bank is not a real bank, but part of a collaborative
project at the National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence involving
technology providers, financial institutions, and other organizations
seeking to adopt mDLs. The purpose of the NCCoE Bank is to explore and
demonstrate how mDLs can be integrated into current financial
institution business processes to augment functions such as online
financial account opening, to provide greater security for high-value
transactions, and to meet requirements for Customer Identification
Program/Know Your Customer (CIP/KYC) at financial institutions.*
