Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology new
========================================

The `NIST Privacy Risk Assessment Methodology (PRAM) <https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework/nist-pram>`__ is a tool that helps organizations analyze, assess,
and prioritize privacy risks to determine how to respond and select appropriate solutions. [1]_ The PRAM can help drive collaboration and communication between
various components of an organization, including privacy, cybersecurity, business, and IT personnel.

Taking on the persona of a financial institution, the NCCoE applied the PRAM to assess privacy risk of using an mDL to establish a financial account through
online remote identity proofing. The content below is representative of how a financial institution may complete a privacy assessment and is exemplary in
nature. It is not intended to be normative in nature, as the responses will vary for each organization. However, completing this process allowed the NCCoE to
create a more impactful set of recommendations and improve the build behind our fictitious NCCoE Bank. It is also worth noting that our example PRAM is
representative of the mDL request and presentation model only, and does not assess alternative models of identity verification which would likely have different
privacy risks. For example, when using document capture of a physical driver’s license there is no selective disclosure of information supported as with mDL.
This would introduce different risks and issues with different impacts for the financial institution. A comparable assessment should be conducted of all
techniques used by financial institutions for identifying and authenticating its users.

The NIST PRAM is a freely available resource any organization can use. However, financial institutions may extend their existing privacy risk assessment
approaches if they have already adopted one. It is recommended that these organization specific approaches consider a detailed evaluation of the data flows and
functions of the technology they are evaluating, similar to the method applied in the PRAM. 

The sections that follow dive into the completed sample privacy risk assessment, answering five key questions for the (not real) NCCoE Bank (referenced later as
“our organization”).

What are the organizational privacy goals?
------------------------------------------

Mission/business needs the system serves
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The term “digital first” describes the increasing population of customers who prefer to interact on-line rather than through traditional methods, such as making
telephone calls or visiting a branch. Pursuing a digital-first strategy prioritizes the customer experience, enables operational scaling, and strengthens
security – crucial aspects of our exemplar financial organizational goals. More specifically, using a mobile driver’s license (mDL) for online account
establishment and access, serves the following needs of our “digital-first” bank customers:

-  **Customer Convenience**: Increased efficacy and accuracy with which customers can present and validate their identity with our online services, reducing the
   need for customers to make in-person visits to a brick-and-mortar branch and expanding the hours when they can complete identity verification.

-  **Operational Efficiency**: Increased automation, reducing manual labor and lowering operational costs.

-  **Customer Empowerment**: Self-service options for account opening, enrollment (setting up secure online access), executing transactions and account
   recovery.

-  **Competitive Advantage**: Attracts “digital-first” customers and expands reach to new markets (e.g. customers from various generations, non-local
   customers [2]_\ :sup:`,`\  [3]_\ :sup:`,`\  [4]_)

-  **Security and Compliance**: Advanced security protocols that improve the accuracy of customer information collected for identity verification. Increase
   ability to report fraud to states whose IDs may be used by bad actors. Improved regulatory compliance for Customer Identification Programs/Customer Due
   Diligence (CIP/CDD).

-  **Increased Customer Service:** Increase the ability of bank tellers to focus more on customer service and less on identifying fraud such as checking
   counterfeit IDs or explaining to customers that they cannot provide service due to a failed security check.

Privacy-preserving goals of the system
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When customers opt to use an mDL for establishing and accessing an online our exemplar financial institution goals are to ensure the following , they benefit
from enhanced privacy protections.

-  **User control and selective data disclosure**: Only data *required* for opening the account is shared, minimizing the data collected and stored—a level of
   granular data control which is unique to the mobile Driver’s License.

-  **Notice and transparency**: Customers are provided with easy-to-understand customer interfaces to enable informed decision-making about sharing their
   personal information. Additionally, mobile wallets commonly offer customers a record of the organizations with which they have shared their information.

-  **Built-in security**: We incorporate strong security into the way we present, store, and transmit customer information. Enabling confidentiality, integrity,
   and availability of data facilitates controls which double as privacy protections for customer data—such as access control, encryption, and
   retention/deletion.

Legal environment in which we operate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Federal Regulations**

As a financial institution, our organization is subject to the Financial Modernization Act of 1999, also known as the Gramm-Leach Bliley Act (GLBA), which
includes:

-  The *Financial Privacy Rule* (governs how financial institutions can collect and disclose customers’ personal financial data),

-  The *Safeguards Rule* (requires all financial institutions to maintain safeguards to protect customer information); and

-  A provision to prevent access to customers’ financial information under false pretenses (“pretexting”).

When our customers establish or access an online financial account, we also are subject to Customer Identification Program (CIP) and Customer Due Diligence
(CDD) regulations – both falling under the USA PATRIOT Act, aimed at preventing fraud and financial crimes.

Cybersecurity and Privacy risk fall under operational risk for our organization. Operational risk is subject to safety and soundness examinations under the FDI
act and Federal Reserve Board supervision and regulation letters.

Source: `FDI Act Section 39 <https://www.fdic.gov/federal-deposit-insurance-act/section-39-standards-safety-and-soundness>`__, `SR
21-14 <https://www.federalreserve.gov/supervisionreg/srletters/sr2114.htm>`__

**State Regulations**

In addition, since we operate in California and Oregon, we also must comply with the California Consumer Privacy Act and the Oregon Consumer Privacy Act.

**International Regulations**

Our mDL efforts will be subject to the regulations in each country where we operate. This PRAM is based upon the requirements of our US operations. Privacy
risks should be evaluated for each country where we introduce mDL, either in a separate PRAM or by integrating international considerations into this PRAM.

**Contractual Requirements**

Certain contracts with key partners include privacy requirements beyond those mandated by law. These may include:

-  Permissible uses of shared data,

-  Specific data retention periods and methods of destruction,

-  Role-based access control for certain data, and

-  Notification procedures for incidents.

These contractual privacy requirements should also be addressed in the PRAM.

How does this mDL system work?
------------------------------

The figure below is an example data flow diagram based on the architecture we have implemented as part of the NCCoE Lab demonstration. This diagram highlights
how data flows through our NCCoE Bank and third-party systems to include government and commercial third parties. Each step of the flow elucidates data actions
relevant to the PRAM.

The below table uses the `privacy problems for
individuals <https://github.com/usnistgov/PrivacyEngCollabSpace/blob/master/tools/risk-assessment/NIST-Privacy-Risk-Assessment-Methodology-PRAM/catalog-PDAP.md>`__
as defined in the NIST PRAM and highlights some of the organization impact that could result if those problems manifested for NCCoE Bank customers.

+====================================+============================================================================+
| (1) The IDMS collects personal     | **Loss of Trust:** Individuals could lose trust in a bank because they’re  |
| attributes self-asserted by the    | uncomfortable with how the bank is handling their data. Example: A         |
| applicant.                         | customer assumes the data they provide is only for account enrollment,     |
|                                    | then they receive an email marketing mailer that is tailored to their      |
|                                    | identity.                                                                  |
|                                    |                                                                            |
|                                    | Customers may also lose trust in the bank if they’re asked for sensitive   |
|                                    | data without knowing why. Example: A customer may not realize SSN is       |
|                                    | required regardless of mDL, in all financial institution account creation  |
|                                    | processes.                                                                 |
+------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (2) The applicant presents an mDL  | **Loss of Trust:** Customers could lose trust in a bank if the data they   |
| from their digital wallet. The     | collect is beyond what’s predictable or expected. Example: A customer may  |
| verifier collects the applicant’s  | think only certain attributes from their mDL are transferred, while the    |
| attributes from the mDL.           | bank may actually collect all attributes from the mDL.                     |
|                                    |                                                                            |
|                                    | **Loss of Autonomy:** A perceived loss of customer control over how their  |
|                                    | data is used. Example: A customer’s data is sent to a third party without  |
|                                    | their knowledge or used in a way they were not made explicitly aware of.   |
+------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (3) The verifier confirms that the | **Loss of Trust:** The customer could lose trust in the bank and its       |
| mDL is valid and discloses the mDL | partners because of how they’re handling the customer data. Example:       |
| attributes to the IDMS. The        |                                                                            |
| verifier disposes of all the mDL   | - **Surveillance (Verifier):** If the verifier maintains data about the    |
| attributes in the verifier by      |   customer and creates a “shadow profile” for each customer and            |
| deleting them immediately after    |   aggregates their data to craft a narrative about their habits.           |
| disclosure.                        |                                                                            |
|                                    | - **Surveillance (Issuer)**: If the verifier directly contacts the issuer  |
|                                    |   to verify each transaction, the issuer could create a pattern of the     |
|                                    |   users’ behaviors and actions online with their mDL.                      |
|                                    |                                                                            |
|                                    | **Dignity Loss:** An issuer tracking customer activities across            |
|                                    | transactions could lead to stress or embarrassment. Example: Issuer uses a |
|                                    | series of transactions to piece together habits of the customer, or        |
|                                    | aspects of the customer’s identity, which they do not expect or want to be |
|                                    | known.                                                                     |
|                                    |                                                                            |
|                                    |                                                                            |
|                                    |                                                                            |
|                                    |                                                                            |
|                                    |                                                                            |

+------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (4) The IDMS creates a unique user | **Loss of Trust:** If a customer identifier is used to aggregate data      |
| identifier for the applicant and   | about the customer’s transactions beyond the financial institution tenant. |
| transfers the identifier along     | Example:                                                                   |
| with all the attributes (both      |                                                                            |
| self-asserted and from the mDL) to | - **Surveillance (IDMS):** Customers may be tracked if the IDMS            |
| the appropriate bank IT back-end   |   aggregates their transactions across different tenants. IDMS could link  |
| applications.                      |   transactions across namespaces and domains for well-intended, mission    |
|                                    |   critical reasons (fraud prevention), or other business reasons, some of  |
|                                    |   which may not be compatible with user preferences (marketing) and some   |
|                                    |   that may be nefarious (targeting).                                       |
|                                    |                                                                            |
|                                    | **Dignity Loss:** An IDMS tracking customer activities across tenants      |
|                                    | could lead to stress or embarrassment. Example: Issuer uses a series of    |
|                                    | transactions to piece together habits of the customer, or aspects of the   |
|                                    | customer’s identity, which they do not expect or want to be known.         |
|                                    |                                                                            |
|                                    | **Economic Loss:** If customer data is breached at the IDMS, this leak may |
|                                    | be used to defraud the individual. Example: A nefarious actor could use    |
|                                    | leaked data to phish a customer and steal their identity, which could      |
|                                    | result in significant economic loss.                                       |
+------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (5) The bank validates that the    | **Loss of Trust:** The bank’s business partner may not effectively secure  |
| application attributes match the   | customer data from external actors. Example:                               |
| Applicant SSN. SSN verifier        |                                                                            |
| responds with “yes” or “no” and    | - **Insecurity:** The bank’s business partner may suffer a data breach by  |
| disposes of the data sent by the   |   an external bad actor that results in the leak of the customer’s SSN     |
| bank back-end. The bank may also   |   and other sensitive information, and ultimately in identity theft.       |
| validate attributes with third     |                                                                            |
| party databases.                   |                                                                            |
+------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (6) Bank IT back-end processes the | **Discrimination:** If assumptions are made about individuals or groups of |
| information gathered, uses its     | individuals based on their self-asserted information, this could result in |
| decision logic to determine what   | discrimination. Joining this self-asserted data with other datasets could  |
| financial offering will be made to | reveal a narrative about an individual. Example: Drawing conclusions about |
| the customer.                      | race or financial situation.                                               |
|                                    |                                                                            |
|                                    | **Economic Loss:** Individuals could receive unfair value in a transaction |
|                                    | due to discrimination. Example: Assuming credit worthiness based solely on |
|                                    | someone’s area code.                                                       |
|                                    |                                                                            |
|                                    | Additionally, if customer data is breached at the bank back end, this leak |
|                                    | may be used to defraud the individual. Example: A nefarious actor could    |
|                                    | use leaked data to phish a customer and steal their identity, which could  |
|                                    | result in significant economic loss.                                       |
|                                    |                                                                            |
|                                    | **Loss of Autonomy**: Customers may lose control over how their data is    |
|                                    | processed, because the bank chooses to process it in a new way internally  |
|                                    | without proper notice (i.e., secondary use or repurposing). Example:       |
|                                    | Customers may expect their personal data to be accessed for only certain   |
|                                    | purposes, such as identity verification when applying for a financial      |
|                                    | product, but then it is later used for fraud scoring without their         |
|                                    | consent.                                                                   |
+------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| (7) Bank creates an account for    | **Loss of Trust:** Customers may lose trust in the bank if they’re unclear |
| the applicant and initiates        | on who has access to which data. Example: A customer doesn’t know why      |
| passkey setup via the IDMS.        | they’re interacting with the IDMS instead of the bank.                     |
