Digital Identities - Mobile Driver's License (mDL)
==================================================

The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) is helping to accelerate the adoption of mobile driverâ€™s license (mDL) standards and best practices. In
collaboration with technology vendors, government agencies, regulators, standards bodies, and organizations seeking to adopt mDLs, the NCCoE is building a
reference architecture demonstrating real world use cases:

1. **Customer Identification Program/Know Your Customer (CIP/KYC) Onboarding and Access** which will demonstrate the use of an mDL and/or Verifiable Credentials
   (VC) for establishing and accessing an online financial account.

2. **U.S. Federal Government Credential Service Provider (CSP) and Federation** which will demonstrate the use of an mDL and/or VC for establishing a CSP
   account to access federated agency systems.

3. **Healthcare and Electronic Prescribe** which will demonstrate the use of an mDL and/or VC for provider access and prescription uses.

NCCoE is currently implementing our first use case to demonstrate how mDLs can be deployed to meet CIP/KYC requirements of financial institutions. To learn more
about this project and the industry collaborators who have partnered with NIST to solve this challenge, please visit our `project web
page <https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/projects/digital-identities-mdl>`__. To gain a better understanding of the technology and standards the NCCoE will be
implementing as part of this project, please consider reading `our blog
series <https://www.nist.gov/blogs/cybersecurity-insights/digital-identities-getting-know-verifiable-digital-credential-ecosystem>`__. *The page you are
currently on* will be used to publish additional content for the NCCoE mDL Project to include project requirements, architectures, and FAQs. Currently we have
published our `Draft CIP/KYC use case requirements here <requirements.html>`__. If you wish to comment on these requirements, you can do so `here <comments.html>`__.
