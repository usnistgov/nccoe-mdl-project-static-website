<p>The following appendix provides recommended controls selected from NIST SP 800-63A Digital Identity Guidelines: Identity Proofing and Enrollment to address the
need for a more consistent process for issuing an mDL to a digital wallet. While the Digital Identity Guidelines are not mandated for state mDL issuers, they
provide a common construct and control set that can support interoperability and trust enhancement among Relying Parties if applied consistently
by issuers of mDLs and other Verifiable Digital Credentials. Terminology used in this profile is consistent with the Digital Identity Guidelines and being is applied
to the specific concepts in the mDL, and more broadly, the verifiable digital credentials ecosystem.</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: The Digital Identity Guidelines define several key concepts that contribute to the degree of assurance an issuer can have in the identity of the
user. The guidelines cover a far greater scope of uses than what is required for this profile. As a result, the following subset of requirements will be
covered.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> While Issuers are ultimately responsible for determining which controls are met before issuing credentials to wallets, many of the controls listed in this profile will be implemented by the wallet provider. Therefore, issuers should work closely with wallet providers to determine how individual wallets meet these controls.</p>

<p>The requirements outlined here largely build off of the baseline requirement for Identity Assurance Level 2 and common requirements that exist across all
assurance levels.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence Requirements</strong>
Evidence of an existing DMV record is required to confirm that an applicant for an mDL has a valid driver’s license with accurate information on file. Issuers
of mDL should collect the following evidence for the issuance process.</p>
<div class="pst-scrollable-table-container"><table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25.0%" />
<col style="width: 75.0%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Identifier</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Control</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>EV-1</p></td>
<td><p>One piece of strong evidence as represented by a Driver’s License or ID issued by the DMV that will be issuing the mDL.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>For most instances of IAL2 identity proofing, more than one piece of evidence is required. However, in the case of mDL the applicant is interacting directly
with the DMV where identity evidence was already collected during previous proofing events. As a result, no additional evidence beyond a valid Driver’s License
or State ID is required. If issuers wish to increase confidence in the identity of a given applicant, additional evidence (e.g., phone account, platform
account) may be used to support issuance processes.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence &amp; Attribute Validation Requirements</strong>
To be a trusted source of information, the mDL must have accurate information tied to the System of Record associated with the applicant’s original driver’s
license or state issued ID. As such, an authoritative records check is expected unlike in other forms of proofing where such access is not available or
afforded. With this comes greater assurance in the correctness and validity of the information signed into the issued credentials.</p>
<div class="pst-scrollable-table-container"><table class="table">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 25.0%" />
<col style="width: 75.0%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="row-odd"><th class="head"><p>Identifier</p></th>
<th class="head"><p>Control</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>VAL-1</p></td>
<td><p>Compare the attributes contained in the presented evidence against the issuers’ authoritative System of Record to resolve the identity to the SOR and
confirm accuracy of the data.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>VAL-2</p></td>
<td><p>Ensure the validity of the presented evidence by confirming the System of Record indicates that the applicant still has a valid driver’s license or state
issued ID.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr class="row-even"><td><p>VAL-3</p></td>
<td><p>(Optional) Confirm the authenticity of the physical evidence by either:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Using automated scanning technology that is able to detect physical security
features, or</p></li>
<li><p>Confirming the integrity of any physical security features through the physical and tactile inspection by a proofing agent at an onsite
location, or</p></li>
<li><p>Confirming the integrity of digital or cryptographic security features.</p></li>
</ol>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>
<p>Note that the requirements for confirming the authenticity of evidence is not mandatory. While issuers may wish to add a physical or automated authenticity
check of evidence to increase confidence in legitimacy of what is being presented, this is less important when coupled with the direct access they maintain to
the System of Record and the ability to conduct a biometric verification against the image stored in the System of Record. If Issuers desire to maintain an
inspection of evidence, they should apply the controls contained in Section 3.13 Requirements for Validation of Physical Evidence in NIST SP 800-63A. Issuers
should also balance the marginal increase in confidence against the usability, accuracy, and cost challenges that will be introduced by physical or automated
inspections.</p>
<p><strong>Verification &amp; Biometric Usage Requirements</strong> <a class="footnote-reference brackets" href="#id2" id="id1" role="doc-noteref"><span class="fn-bracket">[</span>1<span class="fn-bracket">]</span></a>
Verification processes allow for the Issuer to increase confidence that the individual presenting attributes or evidence is the individual who is associated
with that evidence in the System of Record. When verifying an applicant’s identity the Issuer should apply the following controls:</p>

<p><strong>Digital Injections and Fraudulent Media</strong>
Many emerging attacks on remote identity proofing processes, both attended and unattended, pair digital injection attacks with increasingly effective and
available generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools. AI tools are used to create or modify media containing images or videos of applicants and evidence
(i.e., deepfakes) to defeat automated document validation processes, biometric operations, and visual comparisons done by proofing agents. Injection attacks
insert modified or forged media between the capture point, such as a device, and the element conducting the comparison or other operation, such as a server
running the algorithms or a workstation used by a proofing agent. As such, issuers should implement the following controls:</p>

<tr class="row-odd"><td><p>DI-2</p></td>
<td><p>Analyze all digital media submitted during the identity proofing process for artifacts and indicators of potential modification, manipulation, tampering,
or forgery. Test Automated image analysis algorithms against available attack artifacts (i.e., forged and manipulated images and videos) and genuine
media to provide a baseline of performance and to determine the expected rate of false positives and false negatives generated by the system. Augment
algorithmic analysis of media and automated decisioning with manual reviews to address detection errors.</p></td>
